## LDP.js
This private project is a simple reference implementation for the
[W3C Linked Data Platform](http://www.w3.org/2012/ldp) leveraging Node.js, MongoDB and a few other 
js libraries.  Catch it running at [http://ldpjs.mybluemix.net](http://ldpjs.mybluemix.net). We
plan to make it open source (aka a public project).

Current progress has it running and working with most features, namely:
 * BasicContainer
 * DirectContainer (including variants for membership)
 * Formats: JSON-LD and Turtle
