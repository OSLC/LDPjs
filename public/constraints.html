	<h1>LDP.js</h1>

	<p>LDP.js is an LDP server built using <a
		href="http://nodejs.org">Node.js</a> and <a
		href="http://www.mongodb.org/">MongoDB</a>. It accepts most any RDF,
	but does have a few constraints:</p>

	<ul>
		<li>LDP.js does not yet support non-RDF source.</li>
		<li>LDP.js does not support ldp:IndirectContainer.</li>
		<li>Containers can not be modified via PUT.</li>
		<li>The interaction model of a resource cannot be changed by modifying
		its rdf:type after creation. If the resource was created as RDF Source,
		it cannot be changed to a container.</li>
	</ul>

	<blockquote><b>DISCLAIMER</b>: This service is as-is. It could go down at any time and
	change without warning, in fact it might have already changed while you
	were reading this. The data behind this services will get scrubbed
	periodically. If this services gets abused, we will either take it down or
